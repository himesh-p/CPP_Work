//3. Online Food Ordering System:
//   - Problem: Create a system for customers to order food online from multiple restaurants.
//   - Test Case: Ensure that the total cost of an order includes taxes and delivery charges.
//   - Logic: Define an abstract class 'FoodItem' with methods to calculate the price including taxes. Subclasses like 'Pizza', 'Sushi', etc., implement specific price calculation logic and apply taxes accordingly.
